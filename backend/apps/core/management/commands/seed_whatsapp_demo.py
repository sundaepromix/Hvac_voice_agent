"""Seed one dummy WhatsApp support ticket + one dummy WhatsApp lead.

All identifiers are obviously fake (`+10000000999`, `wa.demo@example.test`)
so this can run in any environment without touching real customer records.
Idempotent — uses a sentinel `extracted_fields.demo_seed = "wa-dummy-1"` to
detect existing rows and update instead of duplicate.

Usage:
    python manage.py seed_whatsapp_demo
