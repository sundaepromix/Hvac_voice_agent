              This Privacy Policy explains how Workflow Auth ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses,
              and protects information when you use our hosted product, our website, or any
              integrations we provide. We are committed to handling your data and your
              customers' data responsibly.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Account information.</strong> Business name, contact email,
                phone number, billing address, and the names and emails of users you
                invite to the dashboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Customer interactions.</strong> Call audio, transcripts, SMS / chat
                messages, and any structured data Mary extracts
                (name, phone, address, project description, estimated value).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage data.</strong> Anonymous logs of how you use the dashboard
                (pages visited, actions taken) to improve the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integration data.</strong> When you connect a CRM, calendar, or
                payment provider we receive only the scopes you grant.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How we use it</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>To answer calls, qualify leads, draft quotes, and book jobs on your behalf.</li>
              <li>To sync structured data into the CRMs and tools you connect.</li>
              <li>To bill you accurately (per-minute call usage, monthly platform fee).</li>
              <li>To detect abuse, debug issues, and improve the platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data. We do <strong>not</strong> use your
              customer interactions to train our underlying AI models.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Subprocessors</h2>

            <h2>4. Retention</h2>
            <p>
              Call audio is retained for 30 days by default and then deleted; transcripts are
              retained for 12 months. You can request earlier deletion at any time, and you
              can configure tighter retention in your dashboard settings.
            </p>
